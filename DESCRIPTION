Title: Predict synthetic lethal partners of tumour mutations
Version: 1.1.1
Authors@R: person(given = "Chunxuan", family = "Shao", role = c("aut", "cre"), email = "chunxuan@outlook.com")
Description: An integrated pipeline to predict the potential synthetic lethality partners (SLPs) of tumour mutations, 
   based on gene expression, mutation profiling and cell line genetic screens data. It has builtd-in support for data from cBioPortal.
   The primary SLPs correlating with muations in WT and compensating for the loss of function of mutations are predicted by random forest based 
   methods (GENIE3) and Rank Products, respectively. Genetic screens are employed to identfy consensus SLPs leads to reduced cell viability when perturbed.
